# 20newsgroups-Textclassification

SelfCoded Text classification to Implemented Naive Bayes from scratch.
This code is run on 20newsgroup dataset, with 19997 articles from 20newsgroups.

you can download dataset from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty-Newsgroups

code explains, 
1. How one can extract features from the data.
2. How to obtain dataset from text to train model.
3. fit and predict function for multinomial NaiveBayes without using MultinomialNB classifier.
4. comparison of f1-score between written code with MultinomialNB classifier.
